<!-- Introduction -->
# CTI Data Processing (cti-sys)
Welcome to the repository! The goal of this project is to maintain an efficient and robust data sytem for managing CTI operations, ranging from student tracking, reporting, and ensuring consistency across our programs.

CTI stands for [Computing Talent Initiative][website-url]. A program spearheaded by [Prof. Sathya Narayanan][director-url], the goal is to provide pathways for students to successfully transition from higher education into a successful career in the industry. CTI uses a mix of online courses, workshops, and hands-on experiences to prepare students for real-world development.

This project is primarily being developed internally and for internal use. Many planning documents are internal as well, so if you're interested in contributing, please contact the repository owner, [Nicolas Guerrero][owner-email].
